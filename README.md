# ⛏️ Data-Mining

## Airbnb Data Analysis
This project explores Airbnb listings data from Athens for the years 2019 and 2023. The goal was to analyze trends in availability, pricing, reviews, and other key features over time, identify outliers, and extract meaningful insights about the short-term rental market.

The analysis combines data cleaning and transformation, statistical outlier detection using box plots and IQR filtering, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques (NLTK tokenization, stopword removal, bigram frequency analysis) to uncover patterns in listing descriptions.

As part of the project, we also implemented a content-based recommendation system that suggests similar Airbnb listings based on text descriptions and key listing features, giving users a way to discover relevant alternatives.
